# COVID-19-Scanning-Device
A device designed to makes sure that any person that tries to pass it
doesn't show any symptoms of COVID-19. Once the button is pressed, it 
scans the user and makes sure that their temperature is within the normal
range. If at any point, the user or anyone else tries to pass without 
being cleared first, an alarm will activate, alerting nearby people. 
The buzzer will sound repeatedly and the LED will flash.
